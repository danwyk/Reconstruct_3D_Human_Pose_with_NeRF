## Introduction
The project explores the use of Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) for reconstructing 3D human poses. By applying NeRF, we aim to achieve high-quality 3D reconstructions that are accurate and visually appealing.

## Methodology
The methodology section details the processes and techniques employed to achieve 3D reconstruction. Key steps include:
- Data Collection
- Preprocessing
- Neural Network Architecture
- Training and Evaluation

## Results
The results demonstrate the effectiveness of NeRF in reconstructing 3D human poses. We provide visualizations and quantitative metrics to assess performance.

## Conclusion
The conclusion summarizes the findings and discusses the implications of using NeRF for 3D human pose reconstruction. It also highlights potential future work and improvements.
